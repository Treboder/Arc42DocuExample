# Getting Started

This project demonstrates how to deploy a [arc42](https://arc42.org/) system documentation   
to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
via [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/) 
along with an exemplary [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/) application.  
The app basically consists of a single controller expsosing the endpoint :8080/hello with a welcome message.
The documentation is maintained as [asciidoc](https://asciidoc.org/) with *.adoc files.  
Maven via 'mvn package' will create static html from asciidoc.
Github Pages finally deploys the static html to [https://treboder.github.io/Arc42DocuExample/](https://treboder.github.io/Arc42DocuExample/)
